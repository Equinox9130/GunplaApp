    1) Download GunplaRep.zip
    2) Unzip it into it’s own directory
    3) Open a bash terminal in the new directory
    4) Using the terminal create a virtual environment:
        a) python -m venv venv
    5) Install dependencies with bash:
        a) pip install -r requirements.txt
    6) Run the app:
        a) python app.py

In the app a user can insert kits from their collection, and filter the results with the dropdown menu to the left of the search bar.

Some of my favorites that can be used for comparisons:
    • Real Grade Sazabi
    • High Grade Gundam Calibarn
    • Master Grade Gundam Ground Type

A user may use the clear button to get a fresh set to work with.
